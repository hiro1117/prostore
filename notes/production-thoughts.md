# Overview

This documents lists up my idea and thoughts for our production website.

## TODOs & Ideas

- Appearance mode might not be needed (components/shared/header/mode-toggle.tsx: Section2-12)

  - Took it off.

- APP_NAME and APP_DESCRIPTION might be needed to implement to the website. At section 2, we added constants but took it off the attached process from the website metadata -> This was added in app/layout.tsx. No needs to additional modify.

- NotFoundPage must change style, especially button style

- Three dot for right top was took it off, after Section 2. Three dot icon should be left top for other pages except cart and sign in button remaining those right top.

  - Menu dropdown implementation codes are in Menu component.

- LATEST_PRODUCTS_LIMIT can be change for latest product number
