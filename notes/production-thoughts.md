# Overview

This documents lists up my idea and thoughts for our production website.

## TODOs & Ideas

- Appearance mode might not be needed (components/shared/header/mode-toggle.tsx: Section2-12)
- APP_NAME and APP_DESCRIPTION might be needed to implement to the website. At section 2, we added constants but took it off the attached process from the website metadata -> This was added in app/layout.tsx. No needs to additional modify.
- NotFoundPage must change style, especially button style
